#### Preamble (Completion in progress)
The strong and cold, outermost portion of a planet is conventionally referred to as the lithosphere. When this layer is loaded by volcanoes or polar ice caps, it deviates from its original state and bends. This compensation mechanism gives rise to two principal observables that are detectable from orbit: gravity anomalies, and topographic expressions. These data can be used along with a geophysical model to invert for key parameters such as the density and composition of the loading material, and the strength of the underlaying lithosphere. Lithospheric rigidity is typically modeled assuming that the lithosphere is entirely elastic and using a mathematical construct, _the elastic thickness of the lithosphere_. The strength of the lithosphere and the amount of bending it can sustain is inversely proportional to the elastic thickness. The elastic thickness can also be linked to the thermal state of the interior and provides important constraints for the geologic evolution of planetary bodies. 

#### The gravitational signature of Martian volcanoes

In [Broquet and Wieczorek (2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JE005959), we present an analysis of the gravitational signature of 18 kilometer-sized Martian volcanoes. We model the deformation of the lithosphere under volcanic loads and compare the resulting theoretical gravitation signal to observations. The mean bulk density of the volcanic structures is found to be 3200 ± 200 kg m−3, which is representative of iron-rich basalts, as sampled by the Martian basaltic meteorites. The elastic thickness of the lithosphere is constrained to have been thin, less than 15 km, when the old and low-relief volcanoes (> 3.2 Ga, 0.5 to 7.4 km) formed. This implies that the lithosphere was hot and thin early in geologic history. Conversely, most younger and larger prominent constructs within the Tharsis and Elysium provinces (3 Ga, 5.8 to 21.9 km) were emplaced on a colder and thicker lithosphere, 30 to 100 km, which is consistent with the bulk of their emplacement occurring later in geologic history.
