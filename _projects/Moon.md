#### Preamble (Completion in progress)
The volcanic and magmatic activity of the Moon is intimately tied to its internal thermal and geodynamic evolution through time. While the extrusive nearside maria dominate the volcanic record, little is known regarding their underlying structure and the details of their emplacement. Intrusive activity is even more enigmatic, with most intrusions expressing little to no surface signature. Although prior studies have provided insights into the local igneous activity, no global compilation has been conducted. Below, we present a volumetric inventory of extrusive and intrusive activity.
