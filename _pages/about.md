### About me ###

My scientific interest encompasses various aspects of planetary geophysics and is fueled by data collected from space missions. More specifically, I enjoy studying and modeling large-scale physical processes to unveil the volcanic, tectonic, and geodynamic history of planetary bodies. 

I got my P.h.D in Planetary Geophysics in 2020 at the Observatoire de la CÃ´te d'Azur in Nice, France, working with Mark Wieczorek. I then moved to the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, USA, for a 3 years postdoc with Jeff Andrews-Hanna. I am currently a Humboldt Fellow working at the German Aerospace Center in Berlin, Germany.
